This is taken from blog https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f/comments

================================================================================

1 - First create a repository named my-app using create-react-app.

npm init react-app my-app

PETE I SKIPPED THIS AS I'D ALREADY CREATED REPOSITORY AND LINKED TO WORK ON MY MACHINE.
================================================================================

2- We need to install GitHub Pages package as a dev-dependency.

cd my-app
npm install gh-pages --save-dev

PETE I DID THIS

================================================================================

3- Add properties to package.json file.

The first property we need to add at the top level homepage second we will define this 
as a string and the value will be "http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}" {username} is 
your GitHub username, and {repo-name} is the name of the GitHub repository you 
created it will look like this :

"homepage": "http://yuribenjamin.github.io/my-app"

PETE - I USED "homepage" : "https://peter-lancaster.github.io/react-speed-typing-game-20200608"

Second in the existing scripts property we to need to add predeploy and deploy.

"scripts": {
//...
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}

package.json example

================================================================================

4- Create a Github repository and initialize it and add it as a remote in your local git repository.

Now, create a remote GitHub repository with your app name and go back initialize this
git init
add it as remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:Yuribenjamin/my-app.git

PETE I SKIPPED THIS AS I'D ALREADY CREATED REPOSITORY AND LINKED TO WORK ON MY MACHINE.
HOWEVER, I DID GO INTO THE SETTINGS FOR MY REPOSITORY AND ACTIVATE GITHUB PAGES FOR THE 
APPROPRIATE REPOSITORY

================================================================================

5- Now deploy it to GitHub Pages.

just run the following command :

npm run deploy

successful build

this command will create a branch named gh-pages this branch host your app, and homepage 
property you created in package.json file hold your link for a live preview, or you can 
open the branch setting scroll down to GitHub Pages section you will find this:
Your site is puplished

Visit deployed app

================================================================================

6- commit and push your commit to GitHub. Optionally

git add .
git commit -m "Your awesome message"
git push origin master

Recap

We created React App using create-react-app
then we installed gh-pages as a dev-dependency
and in package.json file we added some properties homepage also in existing scripts property we added predeploy and deploy
and created a remote repository and initialize it
and run npm run deploy to generate a production build and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
Always happy to hear from you

================================================================================

questions and comments from the blog follow: 


Very interesting tutorial Ibrahim!
I have a question: how do you update the production build?
I mean: after deploying the app on GitHub, I realized that I need to change some stuffs. So I have generated new commits. If my app points to the master branch, how can I reflect that new changes on the production build then?

Thanks

yuribenjamin profile image Ibrahim Ragab twitter logo github logo AuthorOct 6 '19Dropdown menu
Hello Zac

you did well but you need to make some changes to make your project run online kindly follow this process carefully:

1 - you need to change repo name because of dots in repo name conflict with URL, zacastaylor it's good enough and works with me.

2- in package.json change homepage with new value should be "zacastaylor.github.io/zacastaylor"

2.1- change predeploy to the new value "npm run build", yarn is fine but it's not tested.

3- in App.js change line 25 to be <Route exact path='/zacastaylor'

4- in component => layout => Header.js line 37 to be <Link to="/zacastaylor"

download the project and change the repo name, after that remove the old connection you can check git remote -v you will see this connected with old repo remove connection by git remote rm this command will take one parameter the full command will be git remote rm origin.

if you check again git remote -v will display nothing to your terminal after that do the change above and make a commit with new changes then push and run npm run deploy.

happy to hear from you Zac, kindly update me if this process success or fail

I got this same problem in the beginning. If you follow this tutorial correctly,then try this one.

Your home page route should be like this







<Route exact path="/your github repo name">





instead for

and in your rendered component change the






<Link to="/your github repo name">





instead for






<Link to="/">





And another important point you should consider. your github repo name must be valid name for example dots or space should not be in your repo name because that things conflict with URL.Favorite heart outline button 3

Hey - does this mean, everytime you update something on the page, we need to Delete Gh-page branch && delete build directory folder, and basically deploy again?

Is there no automatic update happening? (i.e. like, when deployed on netlify or smhtg.) ? Thanks!

Oh thanks for the screenshots. The only difference I noticed was that for some reason even though I installed "gh-pages" yesterday, it wasn't there. I re-installed and gh-pages now appears in package.json.

I then tried to npm run deploy and am still getting an error. Any other thoughts as to what is wrong?

Creating an optimized production build...
Failed to compile.

./src/index.js
Error: [BABEL] /mnt/c/Users/Admin/Desktop/Code/todolist/src/index.js: Cannot find module '@babel/core' (While processing: "/mnt/c/Users/Admin/Desktop/Code/todolist/node_modules/babel-preset-react-app/index.js")

I read that the gh-pages is supposed to create a new branch but that is not happening. I'm going to try to delete the repo and start from scratch. After I make a new repo, should I still be running the following setup commands?
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:LKian/ToDoList.git
git push -u origin master

and THEN running npm run deploy? Still getting an error

Update: I deleted node_modules and package-lock.json and npm installed again. And it says published!!!!!!!!!! Still not showing up on the live page but I know sometimes it takes a while. Will keep you updated :-)

Is it possible to deploy it when you have API Keys in your code?

Normally when we send our code to git, we put the files with API keys or secrets in the .gitignore file and use the Git hub only as a repository. I want to deploy a simple app that has an API in it. Any ideas?

If you're having the following error:

Remove your remote:
git remote remove origin

Then create a new remote. no marks:
git remote add ht tps://github.com/username/repo-name.git

Hey Ibrahim,

Thanks for the tutorial. I've got this to work when I am hosting a react app with only one package.json but now that I am trying to deploy an app with two, I'm not sure how to do it. It is some issue with how to fire the scripts once I start the app. I imagine I'll need to put the deploy and predeploy scripts in the client package.json but I'm not sure if there will be any bugs created because of that. Right now, the react front end is up and loads but I can't seem to access my database to display relevant data. Can you help me?

Here is where its hosted: caseycling.github.io/MERN-Stack/
Here is my code: github.com/caseycling/MERN-Stack/t...

I am trying to install gh-pages. I followed instructions exactly, using npm.

Then I tried using yarn

"predeploy": "yarn build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build", 
yarn deploy

Shows this Error with both npm and yarn

Error: spawn git ENOENT

Hey! Thank you for this tutorial, I was able to deploy my react app successfully. I just had one question, now if I have made some changes to the app, how do I upload them on the deployed site? Do I just run npm run deploy again?

man this gh-pages package is pure magic. Super cool! Took all my suffer of deploying to gh pages. Before it I used to do stuff like track build folder into master branch and do a subtree to gh-pages branch. Like this:

git push origin --delete gh-pages &&
git branch -D gh-pages &&
git subtree split --prefix build -b gh-pages

I don't understand the steps in 4: "Create a Github repository and initialize it and add it as a remote in your local git repository.

Now, create a remote GitHub repository with your app name and go back initialize this"

What is a Github repository? I know that part. But I don't know how to "initialize it" or "add it as a remote in my local git repository". I can't get past that part. Please advise, someone!

hi roly kindly this guide will give a solid understanding of what is git and what is these mysterious commands check git-scm.com/docs/gittutoria , simply your projects are the repository and git init = git initialize your projects for git to track your changes.
stay in touch if you need any help, thanks and happy hacking!

This doesn't work for me at all. I get a 404 Error.

Are you sure there isn't another step you are missing?

My package.json has this :

"name": "shape-shop-frontend",
"homepage": "oliverwatkins.github.io/alpenhof",

I have connected to my remote repository here :

github.com/oliverwatkins/shape-sho...

And then I have run

"npm run deploy"

Are you sure there you don't have to create some io repository? In the github pages it says something about creating an "io" repo :

.github.io

Hey Lidor, your problem in routing double-check this point, this causes the black screen because you define your homepage URL as a start point for routing and you did not specify it in app.js, check the difference between dev server and prod.

Both first commit changes push as usually, then deploy to generate new build files, if something goes wrong delete gh branch and build directory and deploy again.
